# binance-futures-script
A basic python script for trading futures on Binance

# info
I made this script to practice Python and trade some digital assets. 

It uses a mix of SuperTrend signals, take profit targets and stop losses to enter and exit positions.

It's using TA-Lib for technical indicators, SuperTrend is not included in TA-Lib so a function has been written for it.
